# Overview

This part covers async event store client connections and what to take into consideration.

Prooph Event Store Client supports async non-blocking TCP connection to [EventStore](http://eventstore.org/).

The `EventStoreConnection` maintains a full-duplex connection between the client and the Event Store server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking an event-store with Postgres, MySQL or MariaDB as backend, refer to event-store v7.

## PHP Extensions

The protobuf extension from Google is recommended, however it is not required.

When this extension is missing, the client will fallback to use google/protobuf installable via composer.

The `allegro/php-protobuf` extension is **not** compatible.

Additional extensions are only needed if your app necessitates a high numbers of concurrent socket connections.

- [event](https://pecl.php.net/package/event)
- [php-uv](https://github.com/bwoebi/php-uv) (experimental fork)

## Async Example

An example using Amp's event loop:

```php
namespace Prooph\EventStoreClient;

use Amp\Loop;

Loop::run(function () {
    $connection = EventStoreConnectionFactory::createFromEndPoint(
        new EndPoint('eventstore', 1113)
    );

    $connection->connect();

    $slice = $connection->readStreamEventsForward(
        'foo-bar',
        0,
        10,
        true
    );

    \var_dump($slice);
});
```

### Amp 

This library is written using [Amp](https://github.com/amphp/amp/) and works out of the box with it.

### ReactPHP

There is an [adapter](https://github.com/amphp/react-adapter) to make any [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/react/) library compatible with Amp.

### Swoole

There is a [driver](https://github.com/swoole/library/blob/master/src/Swoole/Driver/Amp.php) to be compatible with [swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src).

## Client Installation

```bash
$ composer require prooph/event-store-client
```

To install google/protobuf extension (not needed):

```bash
$ sudo pecl install protobuf
```

And then add `extension=protobuf.so` to your php.ini

Please follow [the official documention](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/php#installation) in order to read alternative installation options.

## Unit tests

Run the server with memory database

```bash
./run-node.sh --run-projections=all --mem-db
```

You need to exclude the ignore group

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group=ignore
```

Those are tests that only work against an empty database and can only be run manually.

Before next run, restart the server. This way you can always start with a clean server.
